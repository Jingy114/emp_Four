UPDATED PLAN 2021-12-17

Set timestamps before and after the method is run so the difference can be found easily.
Organize the timestamps collected in a separate array in ascending order of the array lengths. 

For each array size that we test, use binary and linear search on every element. The timestamps collected will be averaged and placed into the separate array above. 

Implement the above with both recursive and iterative implementations of the two searches and compare the results.

ORIGINAL PLAN 2021-12-16

Goal: Test whether binary search is faster than linear search

SearchDriver class:

* Declare Comparable[] a and populate it with 10 int values (ascending order)

* Print timestamp (pre-search)
* Perform Binary Search on a for target object existing in a
* Print timestamp (post-search)
* Perform Linear Search on a for target object existing in a

* Repeat with Comparable[] b and populate it with 10000 int values (ascending order), searching for an object existing in b
	* Test with target in a low index
	* Test with target in a high index
* Repeat with b, searching for an object NOT existing in b

Mentionable Query:
* The code for both binary and linear searches can be written in numerous ways
	* How do would we know if the code we are currently using is the most efficient versions?
	* Should we use the iterative or recursive verson?
