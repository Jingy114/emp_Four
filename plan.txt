Goal: Test whether binary search is faster than linear search

SearchDriver class:

* Declare Comparable[] a and populate it with 10 int values (ascending order)

* Print timestamp (pre-search)
* Perform Binary Search on a for target object existing in a
* Print timestamp (post-search)
* Perform Linear Search on a for target object existing in a

* Repeat with Comparable[] b and populate it with 10000 int values (ascending order), searching for an object existing in b
	* Test with target in a low index
	* Test with target in a high index
* Repeat with b, searching for an object NOT existing in b

Mentionable Query:
* The code for both binary and linear searches can be written in numerous ways
	* How do would we know if the code we are currently using is the most efficient versions?
	* Should we use the iterative or recursive verson?
