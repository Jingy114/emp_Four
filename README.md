## Team Four 
Roster: Fang Min Chen, Kaitlin Ho, Jing Yi Feng
Duckies: Cat, Biscuit, Apple
		
## Tests Performed
Data collected: Total time (in milliseconds) taken for binary and linear search to search for every single element in an array of length n ans n varies. The times for each are printed, binary and linear respectively, for each array of length n. 



## Results
Array Length / Binary Time / Linear Time:
* 1000 / 2 / 4
* 10000 / 3 / 41
* 100000 / 7 / 3244
* 500000 / 32 / 94871
* 1000000 / 78 / 2392052


## Conclusions
According to our results, binary search is faster than linear search.
We searched for every element in the array w=of n length and we tried different values for n (shown in Results) and clearly, the time it took for binary search is faster than time for linear search.
