Repo Updates:
- Added notes.txt, log.txt, plan.txt files with content

Temporary Edit in SearchDriver:
- Testing how currentTimeMillis works

-------- 2021-12-20 --------

Updated SearchDriver
- Runnable and compilable code
- Modified our code so the timer includes the for loop: the start and end time were taken directly before and after the for loop (the for loop used one 
  of the two searches to search for every element in an array)
- Compile data into a separate array; times for running through each array organized from the shortest to longest array.
